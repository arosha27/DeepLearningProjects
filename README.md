## ‚úÖ Projects Included

### 1. Handwritten Digit Recognition (MNIST Classification)

**Description:**  
A beginner-friendly deep learning project where a feedforward Artificial Neural Network (ANN) is trained to recognize handwritten digits (0‚Äì9) from the MNIST dataset.

**Key Highlights:**
- Data normalization for faster convergence  
- ANN with multiple Dense layers using ReLU and Softmax activation  
- Trained using sparse categorical crossentropy loss  
- Accuracy evaluation and prediction on test images  
- Random visualization of predicted digits

**Tech Stack:**  
`TensorFlow`, `Keras`, `Matplotlib`, `NumPy`, `Scikit-learn`

You can find the full implementation in the `mnist_classification.py` file.
